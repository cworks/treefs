I am I am, I am I am 
I think I am I think I am 
I'm glad I am 
I'm proud I am 
A real religious man 

As I realized 
The mightiest friend 
Can separate 
A chance from fate 
Cause you have all I need to take 
That's why I think I am I am 
(whoa) 

Cause I have prayed I just behave 
Cause saints and sinners 
Are quite the same 
Cause it's my temple 
The whole wide world 
That's why I think I am I am 

I am I am, I am I am 
Think I am 
I think I am 
I'm proud I am 
A real religious man 

I am I am 
I am I am 
I pray I am 
I feel I am 
Oh Lord I am 
God knows I am 
A real religious man 

I am I am, 
I am I am 
I pray I am 
I feel I am 
Oh lord I am 
God knows I am 
A real religious man
