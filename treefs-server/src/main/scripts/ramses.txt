I am singing at the party, 
I am singing it's my turn to sing, at the party.
Everyone is dancing, happy, party, 
But Ramses is not dancing, he does not dance at the party.

At night I play my games, I go to sleep, I think of Ramses.
The people in the street, they eating treats, they eating candies.
Will he ever lose, we'll never know, he'll never fight me, 
Ramses is the greatest, even though he rhymes with pansies (or panties)

Ramses number one, he knows the secrets of desire,

Ramses number one, he put the people all on fire, 
RAPAPAPAPILIAPUPALIAPUPPA
Ramses number one, he likes to rundown to the playa (beach)
